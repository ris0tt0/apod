# Project Title

Astronomy Picture of the Day.

## Description

Using nasa open api, I have created a react application to view the photo/video of the day!

React application that uses material ui for the styling, indexedDB for caching of the apod data. This application also utilizes module federation to expose the apod component for use in a different application.

A working version is hosted [here](http://jay-one-try.srv658343.hstgr.cloud/)
