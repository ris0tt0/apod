# Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)

A single-page React application to explore space through NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day.

## Description

**The Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)** is a single-page application built to explore space through NASAâ€™s Open APIs. This app allows users to browse the daily Astronomy Picture of the Day provided by NASA, offering a unique and educational look at our universe.

You can select any date using the calendar, then click **Select** to view the APOD for that day â€” including its title, description, and high-resolution image or video.

This project is built with **React.js**, uses **Material UI** for styling, **Axios** for API communication, and **IndexedDB** for local caching and offline access. It also utilizes **Module Federation** to expose the APOD component for use in other applications.
